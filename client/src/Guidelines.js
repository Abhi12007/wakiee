      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Wakiee</strong> — a platform designed for spontaneous, real-time
        conversations with new people across the world. To ensure a positive, respectful,
        and safe experience for everyone, <strong>all users must follow these rules</strong>.
        These guidelines form an integral part of our{" "}
        <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>🚫 STRICTLY 18+ ONLY</h2>
      <p>
        Wakiee is a service for <strong>adults only</strong>. ALL USERS MUST BE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR
        OLDER. Access by minors is strictly forbidden under any circumstances, including with
        parental permission. By using Wakiee, you affirm that you are at least 18 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users are expected to use the <strong>Report</strong> button to flag any suspected
        underage users — this helps support our multi-layered <strong>human moderation</strong>
        system to maintain safety and compliance.
      </p>

      <h2>⚠️ Inappropriate Conduct</h2>
      <p>
        Any form of illegal, harmful, or inappropriate behavior is strictly prohibited and may
        result in an immediate permanent ban. This includes, but is not limited to:
      </p>

      <h3>Abuse &amp; Harassment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not insult, bully, threaten, or demean others.</li>
        <li>
          Hate speech, racism, or discrimination based on gender, sexuality, ethnicity, religion,
          or appearance is forbidden.
        </li>
        <li>Use respectful, positive language in both chat and video.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Nudity &amp; Sexual Content</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Absolutely no nudity, partial nudity, or sexual behavior of any kind.</li>
        <li>
          Do not display or imply sexual gestures, body exposure, or adult content. Video chats
          must remain appropriate and focus on your face.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Illegal Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not display, encourage, or discuss illegal acts.</li>
        <li>This includes drug use, violence, or any form of self-harm.</li>
        <li>Displaying weapons or dangerous items is strictly prohibited.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Spam &amp; Solicitation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Wakiee is a personal communication platform, not a marketplace.</li>
        <li>Do not promote websites, social media handles, or products.</li>
        <li>Unsolicited advertising, spamming links, or repeated messages will lead to a ban.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🚷 Gender-Based Solicitation</h2>
      <p>
        Wakiee is <strong>not a dating site</strong>. It is a space for open conversation and
        cultural exchange. Users must not indicate gender preferences (e.g., “M”, “F”, “looking
        for girls/boys”) or use symbols suggesting such. This behavior ruins the experience for
        others and will result in moderation action.
      </p>

      <h2>🕵️ Impersonation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not pretend to be another person, organization, or brand.</li>
        <li>
          The use of fake identities, filters, or pre-recorded videos to impersonate someone else
          is forbidden.
        </li>
        <li>Always show your real live video — no replayed or altered footage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>💬 Advertising, Spam, and Disruptive Content</h2>
      <p>
        Any form of advertising or disruptive behavior in text or video is strictly prohibited.
        This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Posting repetitive, irrelevant, or commercial content.</li>
        <li>Showing printed signs, posters, or advertising material through your camera.</li>
        <li>Directing your camera at any object or screen instead of your face.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Keep the experience personal and interactive — that’s the spirit of Wakiee.</p>

      <h2>🧠 Third-Party Scripts, Bots, and Software</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using unauthorized software, scripts, or automation tools is strictly forbidden.</li>
        <li>Do not attempt to hack, scrape, or manipulate Wakiee’s system or user data.</li>
        <li>Any such activity may result in a permanent ban and possible legal action.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🛡️ Moderation &amp; User Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        Wakiee employs <strong>human moderators</strong> who monitor activity and respond to
        user reports. We may introduce <strong>AI-based moderation tools in the future</strong> to
        improve safety and speed of enforcement.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are connecting with real people in real time.</li>
        <li>
          You are fully responsible for your own behavior and any content you display or share.
        </li>
        <li>Violations may lead to a temporary or permanent ban without prior notice.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Bans cannot be lifted by payment, and repeated offenders will be permanently restricted
        from accessing Wakiee.
      </p>

      <h2>🧒 Protecting Minors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wakiee strictly prohibits anyone under 18 from accessing the platform.</li>
        <li>Users must report any suspected minors immediately using the Report button.</li>
        <li>Accounts or sessions found to involve minors will be immediately terminated.</li>
